This is a simulated flight booking API. It showcases two methods of searching for data. One is by using loops, the rest is by using array methods. Other things include destructuring arrays, using template literals for string interpolation and lambda expressions.

## My APIs
- Search flights
- Book a flight
- Cancel a booking
- View a booking
- View all bookings by flight number

## How to install

- Must have Node.js installed.
- Clone/download the repository
- Open terminal and locate to the root directory of the repo
- Run `node app.js`


## References

- Mostly documentation from JavaScript
- Answers from StackOverflow
- Me + my very, very, burnt out and lost passion in programming.
